# Aerodynamic Forces in a Turn

1. Lift
   - Increased in level turns
   - Divided into vertical and horizontal components
2. Drag
   - Increases with increased angle of attack
3. Centripetal Force 向心力
   - Provided by the horizontal component of lift.
4. Centrifugal Force 离心力

# ![[Adverse Yaw]]

# Overbank and Underbank Tendency

- [[Overbanking]]: When climbing, increasing bank angle without pilot input
- [[Underbank]]: When descending, decreasing bank angle without pilot input
- Why
	- The angle of attack is
		- larger on the outer wing when climbing
		- smaller on the outer wing when descending
- Correction: Constantly monitoring and adjusting the bank angle

# Effects of Turns

- Stall speed
	- Increases as the Angle of Bank increases.
		- At $30°$, 107% of normal stall speed
		- At $45°$, 119% of normal stall speed
		- At $60°$, 141% of normal stall speed
		- At $75°$, 200% of normal stall speed
- Load factor
	- What
		- $\frac{\text{Experienced g-force}}{\text{normal g-force}}$ or $\frac{\text{lift}}{\text{weight}}$
		- You will feel heavier.
	- Increases as the Angle of Bank increases.
		- At $30°$, $L/F=1.15$
		- At $45°$, $L/F=1.4$
		- At $60°$, $L/F=2$
