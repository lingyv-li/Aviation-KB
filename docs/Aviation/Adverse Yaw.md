- What
	- Yawing motion opposite to the intended turn direction
	- Although compensated by design, still noticeable especially at low speed.
- Why
	- up-going wing -> higher AoA -> more drag -> slowing down
	- *Accentuated by*
		- [[Dihedral]] effect
		- High wing
- Compensate
	- When flying
		- Rudder into the turn direction.
	- When designing an aircraft
		- Differential aileron
		- Frise Aileron
			- Airflow separation on the rising aileron
